# support-emails

A list of emails for contacting directly the support department at different companies since it's not always easy to find, or to get it, you need to send your initial request from the website support contact form.

_I'll update how to manage the data probably with a JSON file with automatic README generation for cleanliness and saving me time reviewing PRs, but for now, just add them in company name ASC order in the README._
